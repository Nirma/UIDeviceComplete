# Whats this library about?
`UIDeviceComplete` is an iOS library intended to be a collection of extensions to `UIDevice` 
that provide functionality that `UIDevice` currently lacks like determining which iOS device
you have (i.e iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPhone7 etc) or determining the screen size of the device
in inches.

# Features
- [x] Detect specific device like iPhone 7, iPhone SE or iPad Pro
- [x] Get screen size of device in inches
- [x] Get iOS Device family (iPod, iPhone or iPad)

### Dont see a feature you need?
Feel free to open an Issue requesting the feature you want or send over a pull request!

# Use
All of the extensions are called off of the `dc` variable ***stands for ([UI]DeviceComplete)*** object that this 
library extends onto `UIDevice` that way native methods of `UIDevice` and methods of this library can
easily be seen, also lowering the possibility of naming conflicts.


### Getting common device name

```swift 
UIdevice.current.dc.commonDeviceName // iPad Pro (12.9 inch, Wi-Fi+LTE)
```

### Detecting iOS Device models

```Swift
let device = UIDevice.current.dc.deviceModel

switch device {
    case .iPhoneX:
        print("So hows that iPhone X notch thing working out? Right...")
    case .iPhone6Plus, .iPhone7Plus:
        print("Lots of screen realestate eh?")
    case .iPhoneSE, .iPhone5, iPhone5S:
        print("Less iPhone is more iPhone...")
    case .iPadPro:
        print("Why?")
    default:
        print("Not sure what this is...")
}
```

### Detecting iOS Device Screen Size (Inches)

Screen size can be be queried with the following computed property returning a simple `Double`
that represents the screen size in inches:

```swift
let screenSize: Double = UIDevice.current.dc.screenSize.sizeInches

if screenSize <= 4.0 {
    print("Modest screen size; not so modest price tag")
} else if screenSize >= 5.5 {
    print("Plus is always a plus")
} else {
    print("Chances are this is an iPad or an iPhone (Texas Edition).")
}
```

### Detecting iOS Device Family

If the type of device family is all you are after i.e iPhone or iPad and the specific model
is not important then `DeviceFamily` might be what you need.

```Swift
let deviceFamily = UIDevice.current.dc.deviceFamily

switch deviceFamily {
    case .iPhone:
        print("...phone home?")
    case .iPad:
        print("when it comes to screen size; more is more")
    case .iPod:
        print("Why not?")
    default:
        print("No family...")
}
```
